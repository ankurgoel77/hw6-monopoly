# hw6-monopoly

* I apologize for finishing this homework late. I was able to finsih the core rental analysis by the Saturday night due date, but did not finish the dashboard until Sunday night , 4/26. This was due to my internet being cut off for three days from Wednesday thru Sunday.

* Rental Analysis is located in rental_analysis.ipynb
* Dashboard construction is located in dashboard.ipynb
* After running through the dashboard.ipynb in Jupyter Lab, You can view the dashboard by running the following command and copying the resulting link into a browser:
> panel serve dashboard.ipynb
